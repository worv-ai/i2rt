"""The two startup register checks a motor chain can run before it takes the bus.

One function each, both opt-in on ``DMChainCanInterface``:

* :func:`verify_motor_types` reads ``Gr`` and refuses a chain that does not hold the motor types its
  ``motor_list`` declares. Arms and the Flow Base both run it (``check_motor_types=True``).
* :func:`verify_motor_config` checks ``CTRL_MODE`` -- repairing it -- and compares the ``PMAX``/
  ``VMAX``/``TMAX`` that decide how commands and feedback are scaled. Arms and the Flow Base both run
  it too (``check_motor_config=True``), but under different severity: see ``loop_registers`` and
  ``loop_critical_motor_ids`` below, because an arm is the strictest possible caller of it.

**Neither is called directly.** :func:`run_startup_checks` is the entry point, and it exists because two
rules about *which* checks may run, and in *what order*, have to hold for every caller rather than for
whichever one remembered them:

* **The type check runs first when running both**, and asking for the config check alone is refused
  rather than merely discouraged. A ``Gr`` mismatch means the wrong *part* is fitted, and on the wrong
  part the scaling registers hold that part's own scale; checking type first is what stops
  ``verify_motor_config`` from reporting three consequent mismatches, advising a ``PMAX`` rewrite, and
  writing ``CTRL_MODE`` to Flash on a motor whose repair is to be swapped.
* **A check that was asked for and cannot run refuses**, rather than warning and letting the robot start
  on a chain nobody verified. Both read registers over socketcan and nothing else.

Three constraints shape both, and are why neither is a method on a running chain:

* **They can only run before the chain's socket is open.** ``DMChainCanInterface.__init__`` opens the
  socket, enables every motor and (for some callers) starts its background reader before it returns,
  and ``close()`` neither joins that thread nor allows a restart. Register access needs an idle bus --
  one process, one thread, see ``i2rt/motor_config_tool/dm_motor_registers.md``. So on the path that
  builds a chain, the call sits at the top of that constructor, after its asserts and *before* the branch
  that constructs ``DMSingleMotorCanInterface``: everything above that line is pure Python, which is what
  makes the bus idle there, and there is no later window. The other call site builds no chain at all --
  ``dm_driver.py --survey-only`` runs the checks with ``repair=False`` and returns, which is the only way
  to read a chain's registers without energising it *or* writing to it. Sim robots reach neither --
  :mod:`i2rt.robots.get_robot` returns a
  ``SimRobot`` before building a chain at all -- so the sim-only test suite never touches CAN.
* **A read is retried before it is believed.** ``read_register`` already retries 20x inside ``_tx_rx``
  (~0.65 s). ``verify_motor_types`` retries *that* up to ``MAX_READ_ATTEMPTS`` times, because a refusal
  to start is expensive enough to be worth ~3.8 s of certainty on a chain that will not answer. A NaN
  answer is retried on the same footing as a bus failure: an unwritten Flash cell reads 0xFFFFFFFF,
  which decodes to NaN, and either way the reading is not a gear ratio.
* **Nothing is written unless every motor answered.** A bus we could not read reliably is not a bus to
  commit Flash writes on, and this is also what makes contention safe: a busy bus fails the reads, so
  the checks can never write into another process's traffic. The same rule governs the write phase: the
  first repair that does not stick stops the loop, and the motors behind it are reported as not
  attempted rather than committed over a bus that just dropped one write. And a caller that asked not to
  write at all (``repair=False``, which is what ``--survey-only`` passes) gets the mismatch reported with
  the command that fixes it, so "survey" never means "reconfigured whatever it was pointed at".

Every read is logged as it happens -- successes at INFO, each failed attempt at WARNING -- so an
operator debugging a refusal can see which reads answered and what each said, not only the verdict.

Check 1: motor type (``Gr``)
============================

Whoever builds a chain names a motor type per CAN id and nothing verifies it. ``_motor_on`` proves only
that *a* motor answers at each id; the type string is then trusted for the rest of the session, and
``dm_driver.set_control`` *encodes* every MIT frame with
``MotorType.get_motor_constants(<declared type>)`` while the firmware decodes with its own registers.
A wrong declaration is therefore not a startup error but a constant scale factor on every command,
self-consistent in both directions, with nothing raised anywhere.

``yam_ultra_v2.yml`` is where this bites: it differs from ``yam_ultra_v1.yml`` in exactly one place,
joint 4's ``DM4310`` -> ``DM4340``. Run a v2 arm as ``--arm yam_ultra`` and joint 4's torque is
encoded against ``TORQUE_MAX`` 10 while the motor decodes against 28, so gravity compensation arrives
2.8x too large; run a v1 arm as ``--arm yam_ultra_2`` and it arrives at 0.36x and the arm sags.
Velocity is 3x off either way.

``Gr`` (address 20, gear reduction ratio) is the register that settles it, because it is **read-only**
and describes the physical gearbox. ``PMAX``/``VMAX``/``TMAX`` cannot: they are writable, so they can
be wrong on a correct motor *and* right on a wrong one -- which is why check 2 can never stand in for
this one, and why this one writes nothing. The repair for a mismatch is to correct the types passed in
or the wiring, never the motor.

``hw_ver`` and ``sw_ver`` are read alongside and logged, never compared -- a firmware version is worth
having in a startup log for fleet triage, and there is no single right value to check it against. A
failure to read either is a warning, never a refusal: nothing depends on them.

Check 2: control mode and feedback scaling
==========================================

A chain commands every motor in one ``ControlMode``, and the motor only answers that mode's command
frame if its ``CTRL_MODE`` register agrees -- 1 MIT, 2 pos-speed, 3 speed. One that does not fails late
and misleadingly: ``_motor_on`` enables it over the raw-id frame, which is answered in any mode, so the
chain builds cleanly, and it is the first mode-specific command that goes unanswered. The reader thread
then raises, sets ``running = False``, and the operator is told "Motor interface is not running ...
Please check the E stop or the motor connection" -- which points at the wrong component entirely. So
``verify_motor_config`` takes the chain's control mode, reads ``CTRL_MODE`` from every motor before the
chain is opened, and repairs any that disagrees: written, verified with an independent read, then saved
to Flash. It is the only register either check ever writes.

It also reads ``PMAX``/``VMAX``/``TMAX`` and compares them against ``MotorType.get_motor_constants``,
but **never writes them**. Those three are the firmware half of the MIT feedback scale whose other half
is hard-coded in ``dm_driver``, and a register that disagrees raises no error anywhere -- it silently
rescales every reading. Nothing is written because, unlike ``CTRL_MODE``, these are not one correct
number the software gets to choose: they describe the physical motor, and writing a guess to Flash is
how a mis-scaled machine becomes a permanently mis-scaled one.

Every scaling mismatch is reported; which ones refuse to start is a two-part question, and only one
part is knowable from here:

* **Which registers reach a command or the control loop** follows from the control mode, so
  ``loop_registers`` derives it. ``PMAX`` and ``VMAX`` always scale ``MotorInfo.pos``/``.vel``, in every
  mode. ``TMAX`` is different: on a ``MIT`` chain ``set_control`` *encodes* commanded torque through it,
  so a wrong one mis-scales gravity compensation itself, but a ``VEL`` frame carries a raw float32 rad/s
  and nothing else, so there ``TMAX`` only decodes ``MotorInfo.eff`` -- a telemetry number -- and can
  never block.
* **Which motors are inside the caller's control loop** does not follow from anything here, so it is the
  ``loop_critical_motor_ids`` argument. Omit it and every motor counts, which is the strict policy an
  arm wants: it commands all six in MIT mode. The Flow Base passes its four steering motors, because
  only those are in the swerve loop -- ``PMAX`` there is the wheel angle every row of ``C``/``C_p``/
  ``C_pinv`` is rebuilt from each cycle, and ``VMAX`` is the ``dq`` the odometry integrates, the rate the
  caster-flip brake trips on and the measured half of the caster runaway detector. The same two
  registers on its drive or rail motors mis-scale only translational odometry, so those are logged and
  the base starts. See ``i2rt/flow_base/README.md`` for that reasoning in full.

Reading them at startup and nowhere else is the point. A firmware register cannot change while a robot
is running -- it changes when someone reflashes a motor or reconfigures it from the host tool -- so this
is the only moment worth spending bus time on, and reading the register is exact where inferring a
mismatch from motion needs thresholds.

``CTRL_MODE`` is a uint32 register, which is why its comparison is a plain ``int`` equality with no
tolerance. The scaling registers are float32 and are compared with a relative tolerance instead -- see
``_REL_TOL`` for why an exact compare would report every correctly configured motor as broken.
